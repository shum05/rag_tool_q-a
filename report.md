## Project Overview:

### Goal: 
The goal of this project is to create a tool that can answer questions based on a collection of documents, enhancing the quality and efficiency of information retrieval.

### Tools Used:

#### Chainlit:
 Chainlit is used as the core framework for building conversational AI applications.

#### Haystack: 
This open-source Python framework is used for building end-to-end search and question-answering models.

#### Hugging Face Transformers: 
Hugging Face models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct, are used for natural language understanding and generation.

#### Python Libraries:
 Various Python libraries, including Pandas for data handling and datasets for dataset loading.

### Procedures:

#### Data Ingestion: 
The project starts by loading data from a CSV file. The dataset contains information related to a specific domain.

#### Document Storage:
 An InMemoryDocumentStore is initialized to store the documents. Documents are created from the CSV data, and metadata is attached, such as latitude, longitude, Wikipedia links, and picture links.

#### Prompt Template:
 A prompt template is defined, which serves as the format for questions and answers. It includes placeholders for documents and the question.

#### Hugging Face API Integration:
 The Hugging Face API token is used to access models for natural language understanding and generation. Mistral-7B-Instruct is used for question answering.

#### Message Handling:
 A decorator function is defined to handle incoming messages. It interacts with the Chainlit framework and processes responses from the model.

#### Retriever Initialization:
A BM25Retriever is initialized to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. It's set to return the top-k documents based on BM25 scores.

#### Pipeline Creation: 
A pipeline is created, which integrates the retriever and the prompt node. The retriever fetches relevant documents, and the prompt node generates answers based on the documents and the question.


## Specific Challenges Faced:

### Challenge 1: One of the challenges we encountered was dealing with a diverse dataset with varying document structures.
### Challenge 2: Managing latency when interacting with the Hugging Face API for model responses.
How we Addressed Them:

### Addressing Challenge 1:
 To handle the diverse dataset, we implemented custom data preprocessing and cleaning routines to ensure consistent document formats. This involved removing special characters, standardizing headings, and structuring content uniformly.
### Addressing Challenge 2: 
To mitigate latency, we optimized the pipeline by implementing asynchronous processing, allowing for efficient parallel model requests. This ensured that users would receive quick responses to their queries.
Unique Features or Customizations:

### Unique Feature 1:
 We customized the BM25Retriever to optimize document retrieval by fine-tuning the BM25 parameters. This resulted in improved document ranking and retrieval accuracy.
### Unique Feature 2: 
We added a dynamic answer post-processing step to ensure that responses are well-formed, containing complete sentences for a better user experience.

## Preparing a Live Demo:

We've prepared a live demo to showcase how the RAG tool works. In the demo, we'll take sample questions related to the dataset, and the RAG tool will use the defined pipeline to generate answers based on the documents. We'll also highlight the capabilities to handle a variety of questions, including fact-based, opinion-based, and inferential questions.

## The Impact of the Tool and Potential Applications:

The RAG tool has a significant impact on improving information retrieval and question-answering across various domains. Its potential applications are vast:
### Education: 
It can assist students and educators in quickly finding answers to questions related to course materials and research.
### Customer Support:
 It can be deployed in customer support systems to provide quick and accurate responses to common queries.
### Legal Research:
 It can assist legal professionals in efficiently searching through legal documents and case law.
### Healthcare:
 It can help medical practitioners access up-to-date medical literature for diagnosis and treatment.
### Data Analysis:
 It can be used to extract insights from unstructured data sources, making it valuable for data analysts and researchers.
### Content Recommendation:
 It can be integrated into content recommendation systems to offer personalized content suggestions to users.
In summary, the RAG tool has the potential to streamline and enhance information access and retrieval across a wide range of industries, making it a versatile and valuable tool for knowledge management and decision-making.
