    "In the context of NLP and ML, a \"RAG tool\" often refers to a system or tool that combines retrieval and generation models. Retrieval models are used to search for and retrieve relevant information, while generation models create human-readable text. These tools are used for tasks such as question-answering, chatbots, and content generation. They combine the strengths of both approaches for more effective communication and information retrieval."
